This was made as an assignment for The Odin project. The premise of this exercise was to practice flexbox.

It's designed after their design image:

## Difficulties

- My biggest problem was in the hero section. It took me a while to figure out that I had to put everything in a `div` and give it a certain width so it would align the way I wanted it to, because I shied away from using too many elements.
- Another problem I encountered and still haven't found a (better) solution to is that the elements won't take up the whole width or won't center properly if the browser window is extremely small. I fixed it with giving them another `div` container and setting a `min-width`.
